use of machine learning,python and a data set to predict diabetic patients
In this study, an evaluation of the performance of machine learning classifiers in predicting diabetes disease in individuals
is analysed using experimental and statistical procedures. Classification is a form of data analysis that extracts models
describing important data classes. Such models called classifiers predict categorical (discrete, unordered) class labels 
[3]. Classification splits a dataset into mutually exclusive groups called a class based on suitable attributes 
[4]. Some of the numerous applications of classification include fraud detection, target marketing, performance prediction,
manufacturing and medical diagnosis. Machine learning models can show the result of a patient's test with a pre-test probability
(of the population), to predict or determine the chance of finding a particular disease. Therefore, the aim of this study is to
evaluate the performance of machine learning classifiers in predicting and diagnosing diabetes using historical patient data. The
completed study will provide a clear understanding of the data mining process for medical diagnosis, and also a confidence level 
on the application of machine learning
models on diabetic patient data to determine their status.
